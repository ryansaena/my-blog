# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and today I'm finally making it happen.

## Why Start a Blog?

As developers, we spend a lot of time learning new things — picking up new frameworks, debugging tricky issues, and figuring out how to build things that work. But so much of that knowledge just stays in our heads or gets lost in browser tabs.

This blog is my way of changing that. By writing things down, I can:

- **Solidify my understanding** — explaining something forces you to really get it
- **Create a personal reference** — future me will thank present me
- **Share with others** — maybe my struggles will help someone else

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Things I'm learning (new languages, frameworks, tools)
- Problems I've solved and how I approached them
- Project walkthroughs and tutorials
- Career reflections and tech industry thoughts

## The Stack

This blog itself is built with:

- **Next.js** with the App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Markdown** files for blog posts (easy to write and manage)

Posts are just `.md` files in the `content/posts/` directory — no CMS needed.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
